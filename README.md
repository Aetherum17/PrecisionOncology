# Precision Oncology Project
This repository contains code for the project, which aims to match patients with B-cell lymphoma with drugs that can potentially be used as a cure based on patient mutation data.

To accomplish this task, 4 databases with patient data were combined: 
* Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes (Bjoern Chapuy et al., 2018) [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713087/)
* Genetic and Functional Drivers of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (Anupama Reddy et al., 2017) [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985567/)
* Mutational and structural analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using whole-genome sequencing (Ryan D Morin et al., 2013) [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23699601/)
* Discovery and prioritization of somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by whole-exome sequencing (Jens G Lohr et al., 2012) [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22343534/)

The datasets themselves were downloaded from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics [Link](https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets)
